Work:

1. Class-ify Smoothing data
2. Collect more dataset that is accurate
3. Real time plot of smoothing
4. Try plotting the angle for x


1. Get Z data for accel
2. 1g 268 = 9.81ms
3. 


1. Match X based on Z
2. Measure angle based on tilt 
3. Implement velocity adder - find drift
(has to be done on the pi)
